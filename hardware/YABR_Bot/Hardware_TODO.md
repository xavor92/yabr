* GND Pin for measurement reference
* Increase track width
* Reroute Buttons to usable pins
* Add pulldown/up towards disabled to driver enable signals
* Clearance between mounting hole and capacitor
* RESET/SLEEP connections of DRV8825 need to be connected
* Separate Enable between drivers
* Maybe: Change Drivers?
* Maybe add a few test points?
* Maybe select another pin for STEP2 as GPIO2 is connected to boot mode selection & onboard LED
